Monomakh Unicode font for Old Cyrillic
================================

Monomakh Unicode is based on Monomachus. Used with permission.

Monomachus is a Cyrillic font implemented in a mixed ustav/poluustav
style and intended to cover needs of researches dealing with Slavic
history and philology. It includes all historical Cyrillic characters
currently defined in the Unicode standard and, unlike most other Old
Cyrillic Unicode fonts, attempts to take full advantage of modern
smart font technologies (OpenType and Graphite). In particular it
implements correct diacritics positioning and stacking them over Cyrillic
letters. The font also includes a set of Latin letters designed to be
stylistically compatible with the Cyrillic part, but still recognizable
as Latin.
